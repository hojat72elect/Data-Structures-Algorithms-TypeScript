These are some of the data structures and algorithms I have developed in JavaScript so far:

<ul>
<li>Dictionary</li>
<li>Priority Queue</li>
<li>Queue</li>
<li>Singly Linked List</li>
<li>Stack</li>

</ul>

This repo also contains some of my tests with built-in JS datastructures. They are accessible in `./test/` directory.
